### A place to learn how to build geo apps with ArcGIS platform. 

# ArcGIS API for Python
ArcGIS API for Python is a Python library for working with maps and geospatial data, powered by web GIS. It provides simple and efficient tools for deep learning, sophisticated vector and raster analysis, geocoding, map making, routing and directions, as well as for organizing and managing a GIS with users, groups and information items. In addition to working with your own data, the library enables access to ready to use maps and curated geographic data from Esri and other authoritative sources. It also integrates well with the scientific Python ecosystem and includes rich support for Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Fast.ai, etc. and Jupyter notebook.

To learn more about the API, visit the product page [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/). You can get in touch with the developers of the API and other users like you at the community page [here](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/arcgis-python-api/).

A web map is a [JSON structure](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/core-concepts/web-maps/) that contains the settings required to display a 2D map. ArcGIS and custom applications can load web maps and automatically configure the map extent, basemap, layers and styles, pop-ups, labels and more. Web maps can be created interactively with the Map Viewer and ArcGIS Pro. Web maps are stored in [ArcGIS Online](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview) or ArcGIS Enterprise as an item with a unique ID.


* View the JSON for the web map by using the REST API to access the item in your account. In your web browser, paste in this url. Try formatting the JSON with [this JSON Editor tool](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/).
